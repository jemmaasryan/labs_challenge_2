/** Day 19 Task 1
 * 
 * Write a program called alpha_mirror that takes a string and displays this 
 * string after replacing each alphabetical character by the opposite 
 * alphabetical character, followed by a newline. 'a' becomes 'z', 'Z'
    becomes 'A' 'd' becomes 'w', 'M' becomes 'Nâ€™

    for "abc"
    output "zyx"
